                <p>
                For the branding project, we had to make a branding for Woody and Truus (Veneman & de Groot) because
                they are gonna work together as a duo, so they needed a new branding.

    <h2 id="research">Research Smartlappen</h2>
    <p>
    Veneman & de Groot are making music in the genre Smartlappen, so I first did some research to what Smartlappen
    actually was.<br> I listened to the music and I searched on internet what the genre was. After some feedback
    I did some research to Neo-Smartlappen and what the difference was between this and Smartlappen.

            <h2 id="moodboards">Moodboards</h2>
            <p>
                After I did my research I started making a moodboard in a little bit of an older style, because 
                that's what I thought Smartlappen was. 
                But when I got feedback from Woody, this wasn't really the direction he wanted to go to. He wanted 
                it to be Neo-Smartlappen, so a lot newer, 
                with bright colors. I made a new moodboard on this, and this was way more into the right direction.

    <h2 id="logos">Logos</h2>
    <p>I started creating logos on my iPad based on the research I did and what I thought would fit with this 
        genre. I also generated some AI logos which I put as my design. The feedback I got on this from woody 
        was that he didn't like the initials I used in my logo because it sounded to professional while Smartlappen 
        isn't that serious so he wanted me to use the whole name Veneman & de Groot. He also liked the guitar I 
        used in my last design. Based on this feedback I went further with a new pair of logos. Me and my group 
        put some logos in a enquete and asked the target audience to vote for a style and a logo. we picked out 
        the 2 best logos and again made some new logos on these designs, this is how we came up with our final 
        logo.

    <h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>
    <p>I also made a persona based on the target audience and all the information we already have. I got feedback 
        on my persona. I got told it wasn't a good persona because it wasn't based on the style, and not really 
        on the target audience because at that moment we did not have spoken with them yet. After I did the 
        enquete on the target audience I updated my persona, this one was already better based on the target 
        audience.

    <h2 id="content">Content strategy</h2>
    <p>For the content strategy I looked up how expensive it would be to make merchandise. I did this on some 
        different websites so I could compare them so I could find the best price quality ratio. Our group also 
        made some prototypes of the stickers and the beer coats.

    <h2 id="presentation">Presentation</h2>
    <p>Half way through we did a presentation to show what we already got. This is the feedback we got on the 
        sprint presentation:<br>
        <strong>-</strong> The multicolor rawness in the moodboards is cool and he is curious of this in 'real' 
        content.<br><strong>-</strong> He thinks 3 to 4 times posting on social media is a lot.<br>
        <strong>-</strong> He likes to get younger audience to the pub crawl and really wants the Stratumseindgroup 
        to go there.<br><strong>-</strong> Are all people on social media interested in Smartlappen?<br>
        <strong>-</strong> We can do a research of the interests of people on Stratumseind.<br>
        <strong>-</strong> Give your work the attention it needs, don't put every moodboard on 1 page but put them on 
        different pages.<br><br>
        With this feedback we went further to the final presentation, we explained everything a little bit better, 
        and did better research to the target audience.
        This is the following feedback we got on our final presentation:
        <br><strong>-</strong> Explain the logo better, why did you choose for these colors.<br><strong>-</strong> Everytime you make a choice you want to do an analyse of why this is the best choice.<br><strong>-</strong> Give away hoodies so people can see them and want them<br>

    <p>At the end of this project and at the beginning of the second project we made a retrospective so we could see 
        what we still can improve in the group or what was good and what not. this gave us a nice overview about that.

    <h3>What did I learn</h3>
    <p>I learned to do research about every choice you make, to explain everything clear so the stakeholder and 
        teachers know why you make these choices and just make things. Ask feedback on these things to go further 
        with them. Nothing is wrong. You can just improve everything you make to make it better.</p>
