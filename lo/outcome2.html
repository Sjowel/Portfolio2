    <h2><br>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I didn't have difficulties with this learning outcome. I know how to use version control, and I know the basics of coding a website. The only difficulty I had is setting up my Read Me file because I don't really know a good structure of it.</p>
    
    <h2>Products Development project</h2>
    <h3>Version control</h3>

        <p class="version-control-text">
          I made a repository in GitHub where we all can commit the changes we made on our development project so we can stay up to date about everything anyone did.
        </p>

    <h3>Code</h3>

        <p class="version-control-text">
            I made the on the calculate page the 'basisverzekering', 'Aanvullende verzekering' and the footer of the page. From the health insurance page added the picture to the top, made 'basisverzekering', 'aanvullende verzekering' and copied the footer from the calculate page.<br><br>  I didn't have difficulties making this, it was just copying the design we made on the previous project in Figma. The only thing is that the live server we used sometimes glitched because 3 people worked together in it.

          I made a repository on GitHub when I first started coding my Portfolio website to keep track of all the changes and improvements I made on my website.<br><br> Because I already used a GitHub repository last semester, it wasn't hard for me to set one up.

        <p class="version-control-text">
          For the coding part of my portfolio I also didn't really have issues doing that. I wanted to try something new with the caroussel which is going through my projects, this is made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I searched on YouTube how I could do this and I used ChatGPT to make it perfect for my website. Based on Feedback I also added dots so you can see on which project you are.<br><br> What I want to learn better is JavaScript, because you can do so much cool stuff with it and I don't really understand a lot about it.
