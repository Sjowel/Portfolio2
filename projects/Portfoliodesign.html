            <h2>Trello</h2>
            <p>I made a Trello to keep track of what I already have in my portfolio and what I still need to put in. So it is clearer for myself. Because the more I have the less I keep oriented what I already put in my portfolio. so I don't forget to put stuff in.<br><br>For me this is a good way to keep track of everything I already put in my portfolio. This is the first time I worked like this together with my portfolio and I think it works great.</p>

            <p>
                I decided to make a moodboard about the stuff I like and put it all together to see if there would come out a specific style. I found out that I liked pastel colors, so I found it a good idea to use that.<br>I got the next feedback on this moodboard: <br><strong>"It is good that you made one, but it was better if you could tell more about it, now it just looks like you threw some pictures together."</strong><br><br>I also thought it was a good idea to make a moodboard about Portfolio designs I really like so I also did that. so I could find out what design I wanted to use.<br>I got the following feedback on this moodboard: <strong>"It is smart to make a moodboard with different portfolios to find out what style you like."</strong><br><br>I think this is a good way to find out what design you like and in which color to make it you.

            </h2>
            <p>
                I also wanted a typography which fits me. So I decided to look through the different fonts Figma has to find the perfect font for me. I put the 12 fonts I liked the best in 1 document and typed out my about me text in 5 fonts to see which one I liked the most. that's how I choose Albert Sans. Just a basic font but clearly readable. Which would fit my pastel colors.<br>I got the following feedback on this font research: I first put it in Lorem Ipsum <br><strong>"Put it in your own text to see how it looks on it you can use ChatGPT for it to generate one for you, and align the text to the left because that makes it easier to read."</strong><br><br>I think this was a good way to find the font which will fit the best to what you prefer and the style you think of.

            <p>
                I thought it was a good idea to use the city of Maastricht in my portfolio because I live there. So I choose 2 of the designs in my portfolio moodboard and pasted Maastricht on it and used my name just to see how it would look. I also made 2 designs without Maastricht just to see if I liked this better, but I didn't so I definitely wanted to use Maastricht. I asked around some people which design they prefered and most prefered my fourth design. I also liked it but it felt like something was missing. So I thought maybe put the whole picture in the back with a little fade and keep the picture clear in my name to make my name visable. That's how I found my design.<br> I got the following feedback on this design:<br> <strong>"Maybe add a line around your name to make it much clearer, and fade the picture a little more."</strong><br>I used this feedback and I think it looks much better now.<br><br>I  think it's good to ask feedback on your design to keep improving it, if you don't like it you don't have to use it. But different people have different opinions and that's how you can make the design look better.
