            For Fix that UX we had to fix the UX of a premium calculator on an health insurance website. We had to choose between CZ, Zilveren Kruis or ZEKUR.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did research on the premium calculator on the website of Zilveren Kruis
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to find out which calculator had the most pain points so me and my group could improve that premium calculator.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Me and Angelina made a step-by-step plan of how you can go through the premium calculator on the website of Zilveren Kruis. We wrote down all the steps and all the points we encountered while we went through the process. I also did 2 usertests (1 younger person(between 18 and 35) and one older person (35+)) on this website to look if we missed a pain point or if it was easy enough to go through the website.  
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Zilveren Kruis was the websit with the least pain points so we didn't choose this one to improve because we wanted a little bit of a challenge. We chose the website of ZEKUR because this was the website with the most pain points
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            If you are not sure what website to improve, do research on all of them and look which one has the most pain points. This way you can improve the website with the most pain points and you can learn the most from it.

        <h3>
            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made a redesign of the ZEKUR website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this because this was the website with the most pain points so I wanted to improve this website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I checked the other website we could choose to see what I liked most about these websites and I used these things in my redesign. For example I added a  sticky overview so you can always see what you already have and what it costs. I also removed the painpoints I had when I went through the website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            My whole group made a redesign and we voted which design we liked the best and see if we could still improve things on that design based on what people in my group used in their redesigns. to make the best website. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think it's a good thing to compare your design with everyone else's to see if you can still improve things on your design which we could.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made our redesign clickable in Figma.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this so I could test it with users. and improve the design based on the feedback I got from the users.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I used the prototype function in Figma. Later I found out you could also use functions to make it clickable, which is way faster than making 100 different pages to make it clickable. At the time I made it with prototype I didn't know yet how to use these functions. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The results were a clickable prototype which I could test with users.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think it's a good thing to make your design clickable so you can test it with users and improve the design based on the feedback you get from the users. But next time I'm gonna use functions because this is much easier and faster then prototype.

            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did 2 usertests on the premium calculator of Zilveren Kruis.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to see if we missed any pain points in our research and to see if the website was easy enough to go through.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I set up 2 usertests, one with a younger person (between 18 and 35) and one with an older person (35+). I let them go through the premium calculator and asked them questions about the website and if they had any pain points.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The results were that Zilveren Kruis was the website with the least pain points so we didn't choose this one to improve. The pain points I got out of the usertests were the following:<br>
            - The user went to the calculator with a detour. <br>
            - The user thought he had to fill in all the tabs, but some were optional.<br>
            - The user didn't like it that at the supplementary insurance there were three next to each other and two underneath it which made it harder to compare them.<br>
            - The user thought the letters on the website were a little too small.<br>
            - The user thought the picture in the beginning of the lady wasn't relevant to the website.<br>
            <strong>Improvements I think you can make based on the feedback:</strong><br>
            - Make the calculator easier to find. For example a clear button on the home page.<br>
            - Make it clear which tabs are optional and which are not.<br>
            - Make the supplementary insurance easier to compare.<br>
            - Make an option where you can increase or decrease the size of the letters.<br><br>
            Based on all the pain points we had gathered from the Zilveren Kruis website, it were the least so we didn't choose this website to improve.

        <h3>
            What did I do?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did one usertest on the ZEKUR website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this because as a group we choose to improve the ZEKUR website because this one had the most pain points. I wanted to find out if we missed any pain points on this website. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I used the same usertest as I did with the Zilveren Kruis website. I let the user go through the website and asked him questions about the website and if he had any pain points.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The pain points I got out of the usertest were the following:<br>
            - The user had to look up what some things meant because it wasn't clearly explained on the website. <br>
            - The used pressed the wrong button to calculate the premium.(this one on the home page was for ZZP)<br>
            - The user thought you had to fill in everything while some things were just optional.<br>
            - The user didn't like it that you had to scroll down to see how much the insurance would cost.<br>
            <strong>Improvements I think you can make based on the feedback:</strong><br>
            - Make it clear what everything means on the website.<br>
            - Make it clear which tabs are optional and which are not.<br>
            - Make the premium calculator easier to find.<br>
            - Make it clear how much the insurance would cost without scrolling down.<br><br>
            These were just a few pain points I found because of my usertest. But because everyone else did some there were way more.

            What did I do?

        <p>
            I did a usertest on our redesign of the ZEKUR website.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I did this to see if there were points of improvement on our redesign.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I used the same test as I did for the previous usertests. I let the user go through the website and asked him questions about the website and if he had any pain points.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The user I tested was actually pretty positive about this design he didn't have any pain points which tells us we did good.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            I think usertesting on designs and redesigns is a good way to test something with the target audience and improve something based on the feedback you get from the users.

        <p>
            I learned to do a lot of research so I know what I have to change, I did 5 usertests this project, so I learned how to do usertests properly and how to use that feedback to change my design. I learned that I don't just stop there but after I improved the design. go further and ask feedback again or do another usertest to see if the design has been improved. I also learned how to work with functions to make the design easier clickable instead of making 100 different pages to make it clickable, I still don't really know how to use them, but I know you can and I am starting to learn it. I also got feedback on my presenting skills so I know how to improve that now.
