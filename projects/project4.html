  <h3>
      What did I do?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I did research to the already existing apps that are similar to the app I want to make.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Why did I do that?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I want to look for inspiration and see what I can do to make my app better than the existing apps.
  </p>
  <h3>
      How did I do it?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I looked into the app store and on internet if I could find something similar of what I wanted to make. But I couldn't so I looked at other apps. I knew Snapchat has a similar feature where you can look back to memories, and BeReal also has kind of the same. So I looked at those apps but they were not quite similar to what I wanted.
  </p>
  <h3>
      What were the results?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Not really what I was looking for, so I had to come up with designs and ideas myself.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Conclusion
  </h3>
  <p>
    You can't always find for what your looking for but that's okay, let your creative mind speak.

<h2 id="logos">Logo design</h2>
<h3>
    What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
   I made a logo.
</p>
<h3>
    Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
    I want my app to have a logo so people can recognize it. 
</p>
<h3>
    How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
    I looked up on the internet time capsules for inspiration, based on what I saw I wanted to make a logo. I made it in Adobe Illustrator.<br>
    <img src="/images/inspiration.webp" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 25%;">
</p>
<h3>
    What were the results?
</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/images/Capsuleopen.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 25%;"><br>
    This is the current logo I have now. I got feedback from a friend of mine: <br><strong>"I like it but add some color to make it more colorful."</strong><br> I like that the logo is grey so I can do a lot with the background color of the app I want to make and even make a feature to change the background color because gray always matches with a color.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    looking online for inspiration for for example a logo is a good idea. don't copy it though, make it original.

<h2 id="logos">logo variants</h2>
<h3>
  What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
 I made different variants of my logo to use in my app.
</p>
<h3>
  Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
  So I can show in the app that the time capsule is opened, closed or if it is time to be opened.
</p>
<h3>
  How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
  Again I went to Adobe Illustrator and I added a capsule that is closed, and one that is half open so it is ready to be opened. 
</p>
<h3>
  What were the results?
</h3>
<p>
<img src="/images/Capsuleopening.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 20%;" >
<img src="/images/logo dicht.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 20%;">
<br>
  This on the top. I think it is a good idea to have different variants of the logo so you can see if the time capsule is opened or closed. I got the following feedback on this:<br><strong>"I like it that you have multiple variants of the logo to show multiple actions."</strong>
</p>
<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  It was a good idea to make different variants of the logo to use by different actions.

<h2 id="logos">App design</h2>
<h3>
  What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
  I made an app design in Figma
</p>
<h3>
  Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
  I Want to make a design for my app and test it so it has the best UX.
</p>
<h3>
  How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
  As I told in my <a href="#research">research section</a> there weren't really apps I could get inspiration from so I had to come up with everything myself. I made a design in Figma and made it interactive so I could test it with users.
