    <h1><br><br>Project 1: Branding</h1>
    <h3><br>What is the project about?</h3>
    <p>For the branding project, we had to make a branding for Woody and Truus (Veneman & de Groot) because they are gonna work together as a duo, so they needed a new branding.</p>
    <h2><br>Research</h2>
    <p>I started with making a moodboard for Veneman and de Groot. They're making music in the genre Smartlappen, so I first did some research to what Smartlappen actually was.<br> I listened to the music and I searched on internet what the genre was. After some feedback I did some research to Neo-Smartlappen and what the difference was between this and Smartlappen.

    <h2><br>Moodboards</h2>
    <p>After I did my research I started making a moodboard in a little bit of an older style, because that's what I thought Smartlappen was. But when I got feedback from Woody, this wasn't really the direction he wanted to go to. he wanted it to be Neo-Smartlappen, so a lot newer, with bright colors. I made a new moodboard on this, and this was way more into the right direction.<br>

    <h2><br>Logos</h2>
    <p>I started creating logos on my iPad based on the research I did and what I thought would fit with this genre. I also generated some AI logos which I put as my design. The feedback I got on this from woody was that he didn't like the initials I used in my logo because it sounded to professional while Smartlappen isn't that serious so he wanted me to use the whole name Veneman & de Groot. He also liked the guitar I used in my last design. Based on this feedback I went further with a new pair of logos. Me and my group put some logos in a enquete and asked the target audience to vote for a style and a logo. we picked out the 2 best logos and again made some new logos on these designs, this is how we came up with our final logo.

    <h2><br>Content strategy</h2>
    <p>For the content strategy I looked up how expensive it would be to make merchandise. I did this on some different websites so I could compare them so I could find the best price quality ratio. Our group also made some prototypes of the stickers and the beer coats.

    <h2><br>Presentation</h2>
    <p>Half way through we did a presentation to show what we already got.</P>
