                    I did research on the costs of merchandise for Veneman & de Groot. I used different websites and took the avarage price and avarage quality of all the products we want to produce. I put it in a nice design to make it all visual.<br><br>The research took pretty long but it wasn't that hard to look for prices.

                    I did 2 usertests on the website of Zilveren Kruis to find out of this was the worst UX of the 3 health insurance websites we had to check.<br>For Zilveren Kruis there were only 2 real pain points that came out of the test so my group didn't really find it worth it to redesign the website of Zilveren Kruis. After we chose ZEKUR, I did a new usertest on this website and out there came 4 pain points for my user, and 6 total with the group.

                    When we made the final redesign for the calculate page of the ZEKUR website. I decided to make it clickable. Because I didn't know yet how funtcions worked in Figma, I decided to do it my own way, which took me way too long.

                    <h3>How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?</h3>
                    <p><br> At first I didn't really know what I had to add to this learning outcome, so I struggled with it. Then I did a little research about the learning outcome and now I do know better what I have to do. After I didn't really have difficulties, I made clickable designs and I tested it with users via Figma.</p>
                    <h3><br>Do you want to grow in this learning outcome?</h3>
                    <p><br>Yes, I do want to grow in this learning outcome. I think it is important to test the interactive design you made to make it perfect for the end user, and I think usertests is a good way to interact with the target audience.</p>
