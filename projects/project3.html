                What did I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I set up a repository in GithHub.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I did this so me and my group can work together on the same project.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I went to GitHub and made a new repository. I added my group members to the repository so we can all work together on the project. I added this repository to my VSCode.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
               A group member of mine suggested using Live server so we can work live together and everything is updated in real time which makes it easier to work together and avoid conflicts.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
               I liked working with Live server because if something went wrong you can go back to your previous commit and fix it immediately which makes it much faster than finding out what went wrong and fix it in the repository itself.

                What did I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I made the  'basisverzekering' and 'Aanvullende zorgverzekering' and footer part of the website.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Me and Angelina worked together on this page and thought it was a good idea to split the work.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I used the design we made in Figma for the previous project and started to code it in VS Code. I used the design as a reference and started to code it. I had a little bit of a hard time on the aanvullende verzekering because I didn't really get the losse aanvullende verzekeringen underneath each other. But after looking on internet I fixed it.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
               The results were good. It's a copy of the design we made in Figma and it looks good.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
               It's good to work together so you don't have to do all the work yourself, but keep communicating with each other so you know what the other is doing and it doesn't go wrong.

                What did I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Angelina and I made the health insurance page.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                This was also part of the design we had to do and we made in Figma already for the previous project.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                This one was actually pretty easy because I could use a lot of the code which I already used on the previous page, so I copied that or used those classes.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
               This also just looked like the design we made in Figma, so this was also a success.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
               I think it is easier to work with a design you already made so you can fall back on it if you don't know what to make anymore.
