        <p class="version-control-text">
          We had an interview with Woody, our stakeholder about our first logos and moodboards, I typed out the most important things and made a summary of it so it was clear for us what we had to improve in our logos and moodbaords.<br><br> I think this is a good way to keep your stakeholder up to date with what you are doing and to improve the things you already made.
