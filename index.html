        <p>Hi, my name is JoÃ«lle de Vlam, I am 21 years old and I live in Maastricht. I am doing ICT & Media Design on Fontys<br> 
            in Eindhoven and I am in my second semester. I chose ICT & Media Design because I liked to make websites in my<br>
            first semester, and I think this is what I want in the future. I got my diploma for VMBO-TL in 2019, and I did<br>
            not really know what I wanted to do after, so I just went to an ROC and went to different studies, and that is<br>
            how I found my previous study MBO 4 Bedrijfsadministratie. in 2022 I could have finished this study, but sadly I<br>
            did not pass 2 exams so I had to stay for 2 more months to pass them, which I did, so I got my diploma for <br>
            MBO 4 Bedrijfsadministratie in February 2023. I was motivated to finish that study so I could do this study.<br>
            I actually did not know what I wanted to do after my previous study but I found out I liked making stuff on<br>
            the computer, so my dad said 'Maybe ICT is something for you' that is why I went to different open days and<br>
            that is how I chose this school. So I came from scratch, I did not know anything about ICT, but I like to see<br>
            that I already learned a lot, and I am motivated to learn more. So I have a background in Bedrijfsadministratie,<br>
             and I am starting to learn things about ICT & Media Design.</p>
