          For my own project, project X, I am gonna make an app where you can store memories in a time capsule. I am gonna make the app with html, css and javascript. I am gonna make a design in Figma and test it with users. I am  made a logo and made different variants of it. I am using version control with Github.

  <h3>
      What did I do?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I made a planning for my project before I started it.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Why did I do that?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I want to know what I have to do and when I have to do it so I can keep track of my progress and if I am done in time.
  </p>
  <h3>
      How did I do it?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I look up how long we had for the project and what I had to do. Based on the time I had I made a planning.
  </p>
  <h3>
      What were the results?
  </h3>
  <p>
    The planning I have now. I didn't make it too complex, just for me to understand and see if I am on schedule and it worked pretty good.<br>

  <p>
    Making a planning is a good idea so you can keep track of your progress and see if you are on schedule.

  <h2 id="research">Research existing apps</h2>
  <h3>
      What did I do?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I did research to the already existing apps that are similar to the app I want to make.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Why did I do that?
  </h3>
  <p>
      I want to look for inspiration and see what I can do to make my app better than the existing apps.
  </p>
  <h3>
      How did I do it?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I looked into the app store and on internet if I could find something similar of what I wanted to make. But I couldn't so I looked at other apps. I knew Snapchat has a similar feature where you can look back to memories, and BeReal also has kind of the same. So I looked at those apps but they were not quite similar to what I wanted.
  </p>
  <h3>
      What were the results?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Not really what I was looking for, so I had to come up with designs and ideas myself.
  </p>
  <h3>
      Conclusion
  </h3>
  <p>
    You can't always find for what your looking for but that's okay, let your creative mind speak.

<h2 id="logos">Logo design</h2>
<h3>
    What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
   I made a logo.
</p>
<h3>
    Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
    I want my app to have a logo so people can recognize it. 
</p>
<h3>
    How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
    I looked up on the internet time capsules for inspiration, based on what I saw I wanted to make a logo. I made it in Adobe Illustrator. I used the following picture for inspiration. I liked the simple design of it. I'm not a professional with Adobe Illustrator but I want to learn more of it, that's why I wanted to use it.<br>
    <img src="/images/inspiration.webp" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 25%;">
</p>
<h3>
    What were the results?
</h3>
<p>
  <img src="/images/Capsuleopen.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 25%;"><br>
    This is the current logo I have now. I got feedback from a friend of mine: <br><strong>"I like it but add some color to make it more colorful."</strong><br> I like that the logo is grey so I can do a lot with the background color of the app I want to make and even make a feature to change the background color because gray always matches with a color.
</p>
<h3>
    Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
    looking online for inspiration for for example a logo is a good idea. don't copy it though, make it original.

<h2 id="logovariant">logo variants</h2>
<h3>
  What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
 I made different variants of my logo to use in my app.
</p>
<h3>
  Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
  So I can show in the app that the time capsule is opened, closed or if it is time to be opened.
</p>
<h3>
  How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
  Again I went to Adobe Illustrator and I added a capsule that is closed, and one that is half open so it is ready to be opened. 
</p>
<h3>
  What were the results?
</h3>
<p>
<img src="/images/Capsuleopening.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 20%;" >
<img src="/images/logo dicht.png" alt="inspiration" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 20%;">
<br>
  This on the top. I think it is a good idea to have different variants of the logo so you can see if the time capsule is opened or closed. I got the following feedback on this:<br><strong>"I like it that you have multiple variants of the logo to show multiple actions."</strong>
</p>
<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  It was a good idea to make different variants of the logo to use by different actions.

<h2 id="appdesign">App design Figma</h2>
<h3>
  What did I do?
</h3>
<p>
  I made an app design in Figma
</p>
<h3>
  Why did I do that?
</h3>
<p>
  I Want to make a design for my app and test it so it has the best UX.
</p>
<h3>
  How did I do it?
</h3>
<p>
  As I told in my <a href="#research">research section</a> there weren't really apps I could get inspiration from so I had to come up with everything myself. I made a design in Figma and made it interactive so I could test it with users.
</p>
<h3>
  What were the results?
</h3>
<p>
  The results were the app design I have in Figma right now, and I want to make it into an actual app.
</p>
<h3>
  Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
  Making a design clickable and testing it with users is important to improve the design even more because sometimes you don't see things which other people do see.

      Usertests
    </h2>
    <h3>
      What did I do?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I did 2 usertests on my app design in FIgma.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Why did I do that?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I want to know if my app is user friendly and if people would like to use it. and to get feedback on my design so I can make it better.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How did I do it?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I made a clickable prototype in Figma and let people do some tasks. I asked them to think out loud so I could see what they were thinking. I also asked them some questions about the design.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What were the results?
    </h3>
    <p>
      They were actually pretty positive about the design I made. The only feedback I really got was to make a button for the "name it" feature, so it was more clear you can click on that to go further. I also got the feedback to make an option to give the time capsules a color but I think that's a thing for the future, and I want to make the app functional first.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Conclusion
      </h3>
      <p>
        I'm happy with the results of the usertests. They were really positive about the design I already have and I am gonna use the feedback I got to improve my design.

  <h3>
    What did I do?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I made the app with html, css and javascript.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Why did I do that?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I didn't know how to make an actual app, so I made a phone on a website and made my app in there.
    <img src="/images/phoneLayout.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 40%;">
  </p>
  <h3>
    How did I do it?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I made a phone in html and css and made the app in there. I used javascript to make the app interactive. I copied my design I made in Figma so it'll look like the design I already made. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    What were the results?
  </h3>
  <p>
    I used the feedback I got in one of the usertests to make the "name it" button an actual button so it is more clear you can press on it. I also added a function that if you long press a grid that it gets bigger so you can see your photos or videos bigger instead of in just the small grid. For the rest my design looks kind of the same as my design in Figma.<br>

    <img src="/images/pijl.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" style="width: 7%; margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 10px; margin-bottom: 6px;">
    <img src="/images/NameIt.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 40%;"><br>
    This is how it looks like when you select items, and when you long press one:<br>
    <img src="/images/longpresss.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 32%;">
    <img src="/images/LongPressVideo.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 30%;">
    <img src="/images/LongPressNotes.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 28%;"><br>
    I also made a feature where you can fill in a name for your time capsule, a date when you want to open the time capsule and you can give your time capsule a description.<br>
    <img src="/images/Form.png" alt="Phone Lay-out Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 28%;"><br>
    These are all the pages I made for this project this far. I want to finish it like how I made it in my Figma, but I didn't have enough time to do that yet.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Conclusion
  </h3>
  <p>
    I'm happy with the results of the app. I think it looks good and I'm happy with the feedback I got from the usertests. I want to work further on this project because I liked doing this and it isn't fully done yet because I didn't have enough time.
