                <p>
                For the branding project, we had to make a branding for Woody and Truus (Veneman & de Groot) because
                they are gonna work together as a duo, so they needed a new branding.

    <h3>
        What did I do?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I did some research to the genre Smartlappen. I listened to the music and searched on 
        internet what the genre was. After some feedback I did some research to Neo-Smartlappen and what the 
        difference was between this and Smartlappen.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why did I do that?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I did this research to know what Smartlappen was and what the difference was between Smartlappen and 
        Neo-Smartlappen. This was important because I needed to know what the genre was about so I could make a 
        good branding for Veneman & de Groot.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How did I do it?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I listened to the music and searched on internet what the genre was. After some feedback I did some research 
        to Neo-Smartlappen and what the difference was between this and Smartlappen. I put this all into a Word-document.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What were the results?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The results were that Smartlappen is a genre of Dutch music.. It is music that is very emotional and is
        mostly about love and heartbreak. Neo-Smartlappen is a newer version of 
        Smartlappen, it is a little bit more modern and has a little bit more of a pop sound.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is good to do your research if you don't know what something is before you are gonna make designs
        for it. This way you know what the genre is about and what the target audience is.

                What did I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I made moodboards based on the research I did. I made a moodboard in a little bit of an older style,
                because that's what I thought Smartlappen was. But when I got feedback from Woody, this wasn't really
                the direction he wanted to go to. He wanted it to be Neo-Smartlappen, so a lot newer, with bright colors.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I did this to know what the style of the branding should be. I needed to know what the style was so I
                could make a good branding for Veneman & de Groot.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I looked for pictures of Smartlappen on the internet and put them in a moodboard. I did this in Figma.
                After I made my first moodboard I got the following feedback:<br><strong>"This is a little bit
                too old-fashioned, I want you to focus more on the 'neo' part of smartlappen, so the newer part."</strong>
                <br>

                <br> After I got this feedback I did my research to neo-smartlappen and made a new moodboard, this one was
                into the good direction.
            </p>
            <h3>

                <br>A new moodboard with bright colors and a lot newer style. This was the right direction for the 
                branding of Veneman & de Groot.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                It isn't wrong to make a moodboard in the style you think is correct, but it is important to get
                feedback on this so you can go further into the right direction.

    <h2 id="logos">Logos</h2>
    <h3>
        What did I do?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I created some logos for Veneman & de Groot. I sketched them on my iPad and made some AI logos with ChatGPT.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why did I do that?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I did this to make a good branding for Veneman & de Groot. I needed to make a logo that fits with the genre 
        Smartlappen.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How did I do it?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I first started with making some sketches on my iPad. I made some logos with the initials of Veneman & de Groot. After I got some feedback from the stakeholder:<br><strong>"The V&G is too professional, smartlappen isn't that professional so I prefer 'Veneman & de Groot"</strong><br>
        <img src="/images/SchetsLogos.png" alt="Portfolio Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 25%;">
        <br> With this feedback I sketched a new pair of logos. With the group we put some logos into an enquete and let the target audience vote on it. These were mine:<br>
        <img src="/images/SchetsLogosV2.png" alt="Portfolio Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 40%;">
    </p>
    <h3>
        What were the results?
    </h3>
    <p>
        After we found out what logos the target audience liked. I made a new pair of logos based on these designs. and out of here came our final logo. These were my designs:<br>
        <img src="/images/LogoDesign3.png" alt="Portfolio Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 50%;">
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        It is good to ask feedback on the logos to make more iterations on it and to make a better logo. It is also good to ask the target audience what they like so you can make a logo that fits with the target audience which is also important. This is the final logo:<br>

       I created a persona based on the target audience.

       I did this to find out what the target audience is and what they like. This is important because you need to know what the target audience is so you can make a good branding for them.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How did I do it?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I made a persona based on the target audience and all the information we already have. I got feedback 
        on my persona. I got told it wasn't a good persona because it wasn't based on the style, and not really 
        on the target audience because at that moment we did not have spoken with them yet.<br>
        <img src="/images/Persona1.png" alt="Portfolio Design" class="version-control-img modal-trigger" style="width: 50%;">
        <br>After I did the enquete on the target audience I updated my persona, this one was already better based on the target 
        audience and getting more into the right direction.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What were the results?

        a persona which is actually an representation of the target audience.<br>

        What did I do?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I did cost research for merchandise they can sell.
    <h3>
        Why did I do that?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I did this because Woody told us if we did some research and it isn't too expensive he could maybe make it possible.
    </p>
    <h3>
        How did I do it?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I actually looked on different websites on the internet to find out what normal prices were to make merchandise. I did this for stickers, beer coasts, hoodies, caps and A2-posters.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What were the results?
    </h3>
    <p>
        I took the avarage price of all the websites and put them in a document. I did this for all the products.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conclusion
    </h3>
    <p>
        I think it is a good way to find out how expensive it is to make merchandise. This way you can see if it is possible to make merchandise and sell it. and ask the target audience if they really want it.
