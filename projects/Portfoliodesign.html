                What did I do?
            </h3>
            <p>
               I made a Trello for all the things I had to do this semester.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I made this Trello Board so it is clear for me what I've already done and what I still have to do. Because last time I forgot to put stuff in my portfolio and I think keeping track of it will help me with this issue.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
                For me it was a good way to keep track of everything. I forgot a lot less things to put, for example, in my portfolio.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
               It helped me to keep track of the stuff I still needed to do. At the beginning I forgot to update it because I'm not really used to work with planners, but after a while I got used to it and it helped me a lot.

            </h3>
            <p>
                I made 2 moodboards, the first one based on things I like, like colors, hobbies and destinations. <br>And the other one was portfolios I liked.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why did I do that?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I made the first moodboard to see if there was a specific style I liked and wanted to use, that's how I found out I liked pastel colors and wanted to use them for my portfolio.<br><br> The second moodboard was so I could find out what design I liked and to get inspiration for an own design, because I'm not just gonna copy someone else's design.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I typed in Google things I like like festivals, gaming, travelling and pastel colors, and put them into a moodboard. I got all of them from Google images.<br><br>The second moodboard I looked on WebFlow most of the time, but some of them were from Google images. I put them all together in Figma.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I found out what portfolio style I liked and that I wanted to use light colors with it.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                For me it really helped to make a moodboard of stuff I like and to make a moodboard with portfolio designs so I can find designs I liked and make it into my own style.

            <p>
                I did a font research to find out what font would fit the best with my likings.
            </p>
            <h3>

                I wanted a font that will fit me and my style.

            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                On Figma, I put my name 12 times on a white background and I was scrolling through the fonts and the fonts I liked the most I kept on the white background. When I found 12 fonts I copied some Lorem Ipsum to see what font I prefered in longer text. I got the following feedback on this:<br><strong>"Don't align your text in the center of the screen but put it left because that's easier readable and never use Lorem Ipsum, if necessary ask chatGPT to write a text for you and use that one."</strong><br>I implemented this feedback and used my own text on the 5 fonts I liked most.
            </p>
            <h3>
                What were the results?
            </h3>
            <p>
                After doing this research I found out I liked Albert Sans the most. They all kinda look like each other but I thinks the space between de rows is better and it's just not to big.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                I think doing a font research is a good way to find out what font you like and want to use for, for example, your portfolio or other designs. It can take a while but I think it's worth it.

                I made 4 designs for my portfolio using my moodboards and font research. I kept in mind that I wanted to use a picture of Maastricht because that is where I am from.
            </p>
            <h3>

            </h3>

                I wanted to see what design I liked the most and ask feedback on it to see what other people think about it.
            </p>
            <h3>
                How did I do it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                I made some designs in Figma based on my moodboards. I got the following feedback on it:<br><strong>"I like the fourth design with in your name the city of Maastricht, but maybe you can keep the picture light in the background and make it move through the letters."</strong><br>I used the first part from this feedback, to put the picture lighter on the background and I think it turned out great. I got a little more feedback on this design: <br><strong>"Maybe put a line next to your name to make your name much clearer because it is hard to read at first look right now."</strong><br>I also did this and it made it much easier to read.<br>After this I asked feedback once more:<br><strong>"Maybe just make the background white and the letters a little lower into the buildings so the buildings are jumping out a little more."</strong><br>I showed him my first design and he agreed what I had now looked better.

            <p>
                The result is what I have now as landing page on my portfolio. It's my name big in the screen with Maastricht light in the background but it is clear that it's Maastricht.

            <p>
                Asking feedback helped me a lot with this design. I had my preferences of course but hearing the opinion of other people helped me to make my design better because I wouldn't come up with some of the ideas.

            What did I do?

        <p>
            My portfolio was still white at this point so I wanted to add more color to it.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Why did I do that?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I thought white was a little boring for what I had in mind for my portfolio so I thought it was a good idea to do a color research.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How did I do it?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I copied the design I had in Figma 6 times to make them all a different color and see what I liked most or if I even like one. I still thought they didn't match with what I had in mind, so I decided to take 2 colors from the picture of Maastricht to use as primary colors for my portfolio, and this worked better.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I found out that I liked the colors from the picture of Maastricht the most and I used them as primary colors for my portfolio. I asked feedback on it: <br><strong>"It looks like you just took two random colors, try to play a little with the design to see what fits best."</strong><br> I explained her that I took these color from the picture and I already did a color research. Because I could explain why I choose the colors she found it good that I used them.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you can tell why you made a decision, people will understand it better and maybe even like it more. I think it's important to know why you made a decision and to be able to explain it to others. I also think it's a good idea to do a color research and match with other colors on your portfolio to see what fits best.

        <p>
            I wanted to write a little about my background and how I choose for this study. I asked feedback on the design of the text when it was done:<br><strong>"your text doesn't really match your design, first of start with the width, don't put it all the way at the side but put all the text a little more to the middle, and look at how you can match the text more with your design"</strong><br> I agreed with this feedback because I didn't feel like it really matched with my design. I changed the width so it was more in the middle of the screen, I made the 'title' blue and the text brown so it matched more with my design.
        </p>
        <h3>
            What were the results?

            The result is what I have on my portfolio right now. I asked feedback again and the coach agreed with me that it was much better.

        <h3>
            Conclusion

        <p>
            I thought the about me text wasn't that important on my website so I didn't really thought it was that important to match it with my website. (I don't know why I thought that) but it looks much better now that it's matched.

                I searched on YouTube and Google how to make a carousel function with JavaScript and I recreated it into my design. I asked for feedback on this design: <br><strong>"Add extra arrows on the side so you don't have to wait for all the project to rotate because that may take a while."</strong> <br> This was also an idea I already had, so I added the arrows to both sides. I also got some more feedback:<br><strong>"Add dots under the projects so you can see at which project number you are and how many there are still left."</strong><br> I didn't think of that one but I thought it was a good idea. I also searched on YouTube how I had to do this and this wasn't really hard to do.

                I first made a design in Figma how I like to have the buttons and after I created it in VS Code. I asked feedback on this design:<br><strong>"Because you have 5 buttons, 2-2-1 isn't a good design, you can better put them under each other because it is an uneven number."</strong><br> I didn't really thought of this but it pretty much made sense so I redesigned the buttons and it indeed looked much better with them all underneath each other instead of 2-2-1.

Put the title also in the box so it is more clear that that's the box where the text is from, because now it can look like the text can be in the container on top of the title"</strong><br> I changed this and it does look better now.

                The result is what I have now on my portfolio, I think it is simple but not boring, just like I wanted it.

            <p>
                I think it's a good way to keep track of your changes and to be able to go back to a previous version if something went wrong. I got a tip that I can make different branches for example for the project pages and the outcome pages to keep it more organized. I think this is a good idea and I will do this next time.

                This is a good way to show all the projects I did in a visual way, and also a good way to learn more about these code languages.

            <p>
                I started to make a prototype in Figma and got feedback on that. After this was after my likings I tried to make this withh HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After asking some feedback the design of course isn't the same as the design I made in Figma but I think it's good to make changed over time.

            <h3>
                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                It is good to have a prototype in Figma you can fall back on so you don't create something out of your head. It's also good to ask feedback to make changes on the design so it doesn't matter if it isn't the actual same. I also learned more about these coding languages so I think a portfolio is a good way to learn more about that.

                I searched on the internet how to make a good README file and I found a good structure for it. I basically copies it but with my own information. I asked feedback on it but it was good so I didn't have to change anything.
