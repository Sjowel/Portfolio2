    <h1><br><br>Introduction Week</h1>
    <p><br>For the introduction week we had to come up with a product which could be reality in 50 years.<br></p>
    <h2><br>Moodboard<br><br></h2>
    <p><img class="overlay-image" src="/images/Moodboard.png" alt="Moodboard Image" style="width: 50%; height: auto;"><br>
    <br>Together with my group we started making a moodboard on the whiteboard, which I later made on Figma to make it clearer for myself and better readable.<br><br>

    <h2><br><br>Planning.</h2>
    <p><br>Our goal was to combat food waste. <br>Our planning started on Tuesday: brainstorm ideas and define the idea.<br>
    Wednesday: Start with the ideation of how we wanted our product to be and ask feedback on it.<br>
    Thursday:  Start prototyping of our product and ask feedback on it.<br>
    Friday: Test the prototype, wrap-up and finish everything and present the product.</p>
    <h2><br>Idea</h2>
    <p><br>We came up with 3 ideas we really liked: the meal microwave, it makes meals of your choice en heats them up.<br> an AI fridge, it comes up with recipes based on what you have in your fridge. and a  groceries and meal robot, it does<br> your groceries and cooks for you.<br><br>
        we decided to go for the AI robot.<br> When we showed our idea to the teacher he said half of the class already had that idea and it's only 5 to 10 years to build in the future, not 50. so we had to choose something else so we started brainstorming again.<br></p>
    <h2><br>Brainstorming</h2>
    <p><br>We got as a tip that we just had to write down every idea we could think of, crazy or not, and that we should choose one of these ideas.<br>

    </p>
    <h2><br>Final idea.<br></h2>
    <p>Our final idea was a pill that you can put into a tube in your upper arm and then press a button underneath it, so you can travel to the destination of the pill and eat the dish from what the pill is, and communicate with friends through VR glasses. we would call the product Ezy Meal.</p>
