          I made a Trello for myself so I can stay up to date about what I still have to do. I update it every week and add new things when there are new things to do.<br><br>I find this a good way to keep track of what I still have to do and I check it every week to see what I still have to do.

              <p>
                For my portfolio I asked feedback from different teachers. Mainly I got pretty positive feedback, but sometimes I got point which I could improve.<br> I found it annoying of two teachers said something different, one liked something and the other one didn't like it at all. That's when I choose for what I liked because that's also important. To do what you like.

          <p class="version-control-text">
            I find it hard to already tell what I want to be in the future in the design world. But for now I really like to develop stuff. I think I am not creative enough to design stuff, so I think I just want to develop. Things I don't like about what is designed I will give my opinion about so that I do have an opinion and it doesn't look like I am just there to design. But developing is what I like the most right now.
