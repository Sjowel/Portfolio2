    <h1><br>Project 2: Fix that UX</h1>
    <h3><br>What is the project about?</h3>
    <p>For Fix that UX we had to fix the UX of a premium calculator on an health insurance website. We had to choose between CZ, Zilveren Kruis or ZEKUR.</p>
    <h2><br>Research</h2>
    <p>Firstly me and Angelina started to look at the premium calculator on the website of Zilveren Kruis. (My group split in pairs of 3 to check the 3 different websites.) In Figma we made a step-by-step plan of how you had to go through the premium calculator. We wrote down all the steps and all the points we encountered while we went through the process. I also did 2 usertests (1 younger person(between 18 and 35) and one older person (35+)) on this website to look if we missed a pain point or if it was easy enough to go through the website.<br>As group we found out Zilveren Kruis was the website with the least pain points so we didn't choose this one to improve. We choose ZEKUR because on this website there were the most pain points based on our own research and the 4 usertests who were done on here by the people who researched this website.
        After we decided to go for ZEKUR. We decided to do one more usertest per person on this website to look if there were more painpoints we didn't see. When we did this I wrote down my own painpoints of this website.

    <h2><br>Redesign</h2>
    <p>After we did our research, I made a redesign of the premium calculator of the ZEKUR. Website. I already liked the style of the website so I didn't want to change a lot about this but I removed the painpoints and added a sticky overview on the side of the calculator because I really liked this on the Zilveren Kruis website.<br>When I did my redesign on the premium calculator we voted which design we liked the best and see if we could still improve things on that design based on what people in my group used in their redesigns.

    <h2><br>Prototype</h2>
    <p>When we choose our design where we would go further with, I made the design clickable in Figma. So I could thest this with users which I did.
