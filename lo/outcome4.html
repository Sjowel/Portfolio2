    <h3>Interview Woody</h3>

        <p class="version-control-text">
          We had an interview with Woody, our stakeholder about our first logos and moodboards, I typed out the most important things and made a summary of it so it was clear for us what we had to improve in our logos and moodbaords.<br><br> I think this is a good way to keep your stakeholder up to date with what you are doing and to improve the things you already made.

          <p class="version-control-text">
            A classmate of mine didn't know how to put her website online on Hera, so I helped her with that. I explained to her how she could do it and I showed her how to do it. I think it's important to help each other because you can learn from each other and you can help each other out when you don't know something.

             <p><br>Yes, I want to grow in this learning outcome, I want to ask more feedback to improve my design more then I already do. But I think I already grew compared to last year.s
