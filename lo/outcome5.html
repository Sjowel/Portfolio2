          I made a Trello for myself so I can stay up to date about what I still have to do. I update it every week and add new things when there are new things to do.<br><br>I find this a good way to keep track of what I still have to do and I check it every week to see what I still have to do.

            <h3>How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?</h3>
            <p><br>In the beginning I did have difficulties asking feedback. I wanted to make my design how I liked it and I didn't really care about the opinion from other people. Later on I found out asking for feedback is more effective to get a better design. Other people have different ideas which can make it better.</p>
            <h3>Do you want to grow in this learning outcome?</h3>
           <p><br>Yes, I want to learn to ask more feedback and reflect on it. I want to use the feedback I get on the projects I make to make it even better. But I also still want to have my own opinion, if I don't like anything I just keep it into my own style.

              I find it hard to say exactly what I want to be in the design world because I’m still figuring it out. For now, I really enjoy developing things. I feel like I’m not super creative when it comes to designing, so I think developing is more my thing. I like taking ideas and turning them into something that works.
              That said, I do want to be involved in the design process. If there’s something I don’t like about a design, I’ll always share my opinion. That way, I’m still part of the process and contributing, even if I’m not the one designing.
              Right now, my main goal is to get better at developing. I want to learn more about coding, new tools, and how to build things that not only work well but also feel smooth to use. I also want to get better at working with designers, so I can understand their ideas and make sure what I build fits what they have in mind.
              For now, I see myself as someone who focuses on development, but I’m keeping an open mind as I explore more about what I enjoy in the design world.

          <div class="version-control-text">
            <p>
               I thought it was a good idea to find out what personality I have, and I know I can also use it for this learning outcome, to find out who I am. I did the test on https://www.16personalities.com/ and I found out I am an Adventurer (ISFP-A).
               What I found interesting is that this personality is described as creative, practical, and someone who likes to explore different ideas and possibilities. I don't really think I am a very creative person myself. But I do like to explore new stuff and possibilities. I think that's why I like developing. I can explore new things and see what I can do with it.
