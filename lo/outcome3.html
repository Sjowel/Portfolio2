    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I didn't have a hard time making iterations, I still have to figure out how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, but with some tutorials on YouTube you can get pretty far. I also used my iPad to sketch logo's and stuff on so that was easy to use.</p>

    <h3>Logos</h3>

            <p>
                I started making logos for the project. I drew 7 logos myself and made 1 in Adobe Illustrator. I didn't really do research before I made the logos but I just made what came to my mind. After I made them I got some feedback from Woody, our stakeholder, and he said the V&G looked too professional so he wanted the full name 'Veneman & de Groot'. He liked the Guitar because that's how you see that it has something to do with music. When I got this feedback I went further with creating new logos. These were much better. My design and another logo were chosen as the best logos by a survey. Based on these I made other logos just like my whole group. And out of them, the logo we were going to use for the project was chosen.

                    I made 2 moodboards for the project. The first one is a bit of an older style based on what I thought smartlappen was, but based on the feedback I got, I changed the style to Neon-like colors.<br><br> 
                    I didn't think it was hard to make a moodboard, but because I was focused on the old school Smartlappen style, I forgot the Neo part so the newer part of Smartlappen.

                    For the target audience of Veneman & de Groot I made a persona to make it more clear what our target audience exactly is. I got the feedback that this wasn't right and I took information based on what I thought instead of the target audience.<br>So when we did a little more research I made another persona more into our style and more into the target audience.<br><br>I actually found it hard to make a good persona about the target audience because I didn't really know what should be in it.

                    We chose the website ZEKUR to improve. I made a redesign of the website in Figma, based on all the pain points we found and based on 4 usertests my group did on this design. After we chose one, we put the best points of all the other redesigns and changed the best redesign.<br>We also did this for the information page.<br><br> It wasn't that hard keeping the pain points in mind and to make a redesign on this.
