            For Fix that UX we had to fix the UX of a premium calculator on an health insurance website. We had to choose between CZ, Zilveren Kruis or ZEKUR.

            Research Zilveren Kruis
        </h2>
        <p>
            Firstly me and Angelina started to look at the premium calculator on the website of Zilveren Kruis. (My group split in pairs of 3 to check the 3 different websites.) In Figma we made a step-by-step plan of how you had to go through the premium calculator. We wrote down all the steps and all the points we encountered while we went through the process. I also did 2 usertests (1 younger person(between 18 and 35) and one older person (35+)) on this website to look if we missed a pain point or if it was easy enough to go through the website.<br>As group we found out Zilveren Kruis was the website with the least pain points so we didn't choose this one to improve. We choose ZEKUR because on this website there were the most pain points based on our own research and the 4 usertests who were done on here by the people who researched this website.
            After we decided to go for ZEKUR. We decided to do one more usertest per person on this website to look if there were more painpoints we didn't see. When we did this I wrote down my own painpoints of this website.

            Redesign ZEKUR calculator
        </h2>
        <p>
            After we did our research, I made a redesign of the premium calculator of the ZEKUR. Website. I already liked the style of the website so I didn't want to change a lot about this but I removed the painpoints and added a sticky overview on the side of the calculator because I really liked this on the Zilveren Kruis website.<br>When I did my redesign on the premium calculator we voted which design we liked the best and see if we could still improve things on that design based on what people in my group used in their redesigns.

        <p>
            When we choose our design where we would go further with, I made the design clickable in Figma. So I could test this with users, which I did.

        <h3>
            Usertests Zilveren Kruis
        </h3>
        <p>
            I also did some usertests. I did 2 for the website Zilveren Kruis, to find out if this UX-design is the worst design out of the 3 health insurance websites we had to check, based on the usertests and our own painpoints we only had 3 points for improvement.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Usertest ZEKUR
        </h3>
        <p>
         Because ZEKUR had the most points of improvement we decided as a group that everyone had to do 1 more usertest. So that's what I did. Out of this usertest came a little bit more pain points.</p> 
         <h3>
            Usertest redesign ZEKUR
         </h3>
         <p>
            When we chose the ZEKUR website to redesign I did another usertest of the new website. I thought there would be maybe some points of improvements, but my user was very positive with the design and didn't have points of improvement for us.

        <p>
            When I made the redesign and made it clickable, I also made a redesign of the informationpage so that also fits the redesign of the calculate page. I just kept the style we choose and changed the information page so it fits the new style.

        <p>
            Half way through we had a sprint presentation about our design choices and why we chose Zekur we got the following feedback:<br><strong>-</strong> Presentation was good and the journey map made the proces much clearer<br><strong>-</strong> The heuristic evaluation of Nielson Normal is a must.<br><strong>-</strong> You need more content in the body.<br><br>At the end of this project we had the final presentation in Amsterdam at the company we did the project for. I presented the research of Zilveren Kruis. We got the following feedback on this presentation:<br><strong>-</strong> We had to take more time to show the prototype so the stakeholder had a good view of our choices.<br><strong>-</strong> We had to keep the summary smaller so we had more time to show the changes we made based in the previous presentation.<br><strong>-</strong> Highlight the changes you made more so it's clearer what changed.<br><strong>-</strong> Putting the old and new design next to each other was good so the improvements were clearer.<br><strong>-</strong> Look more to the public when presenting to make it more personal.

            What did I learn
        </h2>
        <p>
            I learned to do a lot of research so I know what I have to change, I did 5 usertests this project, so I learned how to do usertests properly and how to use that feedback to change my design. I learned that I don't just stop there but after I improved the design. go further and ask feedback again or do another usertest to see if the design has been improved. I also learned how to work with functions to make the design easier clickable instead of making 100 different pages to make it clickable, I still don't really know how to use them, but I know you can and I am starting to learn it. I also got feedback on my presenting skills so I know how to improve that now.
