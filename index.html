        <h1>Hi, I'm JoÃ«lle de Vlam,</h1><br>
        <p>I am 21 years old and I live in Maastricht. I am doing ICT & Media Design on Fontys<br> 
            in Eindhoven and I am in my second semester. I chose ICT & Media Design because I liked to make websites in my 
            first semester, and I think this is what I want in the future.<br><br> I got my diploma for VMBO-TL in 2019, and I did 
            not really know what I wanted to do after, so I just went to an ROC and went to different studies, and that is 
            how I found my previous study MBO 4 Bedrijfsadministratie.<br><br> in 2022 I could have finished this study, but sadly I 
            did not pass 2 exams so I had to stay for 2 more months to pass them, which I did, so I got my diploma for 
            MBO 4 Bedrijfsadministratie in February 2023.<br><br> I was motivated to finish that study so I could do this study. 
            I actually did not know what I wanted to do after my previous study but I found out I liked making stuff on 
            the computer, so my dad said 'Maybe ICT is something for you' that is why I went to different open days and 
            that is how I chose this school.<br><br> So I came from scratch, I did not know anything about ICT, but I like to see 
            that I already learned a lot, and I am motivated to learn more. So I have a background in Bedrijfsadministratie, 
             and I am starting to learn things about ICT & Media Design.</p>
