    <p>I didn't have a hard time making iterations, I still have to figure out how to use Photoshop and Illustrator, but with some tutorials on YouTube you can get pretty far. I also used my iPad to sketch logo's and stuff on so that was easy to use.</p>

                I started making logos for the project. I drew 7 logos myself and made 1 in Adobe Illustrator. I didn't really do research before I made the logos but I just made what came to my mind. After I made them I got some feedback from Woody, our stakeholder, and he said the V&G looked too professional so he wanted the full name 'Veneman & de Groot'. He liked the Guitar because that's how you see that it has something to do with music. When I got this feedback I went further with creating new logos. These were much better. My design and another logo were chosen as the best logos by a survey. Based on these I made other logos just like my whole group. And out of them, the logo we were going to use for the project was chosen.

                    I made 2 moodboards for the project. The first one is a bit of an older style based on what I thought smartlappen was, but based on the feedback I got, I changed the style to Neon-like colors.<br><br> 
                    I didn't think it was hard to make a moodboard, but because I was focused on the old school Smartlappen style, I forgot the Neo part so the newer part of Smartlappen.

                    For the target audience of Veneman & de Groot I made a persona to make it more clear what our target audience exactly is. I got the feedback that this wasn't right and I took information based on what I thought instead of the target audience.<br>So when we did a little more research I made another persona more into our style and more into the target audience.<br><br>I actually found it hard to make a good persona about the target audience because I didn't really know what should be in it.

                    We chose the website ZEKUR to improve. I made a redesign of the website in Figma, based on all the pain points we found and based on 4 usertests my group did on this design. After we chose one, we put the best points of all the other redesigns and changed the best redesign.<br>We also did this for the information page.<br><br> It wasn't that hard keeping the pain points in mind and to make a redesign on this.

                    To get a good font for my portfolio I tried a lot of different fonts in Figma to see what I liked and what not. I added the 12 fonts I liked most to a sheet and typed text on other sheets to see if I actually liked it if there was written more on a page.<br><br>I think this is a good way to find your font for your portfolio because you can really see what you like.

              <h3>How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?</h3>
              <p><br>This actually went great. I realised it is a good thing to make a lot of iterations and ask feedback on it to keep improving your design. the only annoying part is when you ask different people for feedback and they all say something different. Then you have to choose what you like the most and what you think is the best for the project. But it's also a good thing to have different opinions.</p>
              <h3>Do you want to grow in this learning outcome?</h3>
             <p><br>Yes, I want to grow in this learning outcome, I want to ask more feedback to improve my design more then I already do. But I think I already grew compared to last years.
