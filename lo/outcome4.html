          <h3>How did it go and do you notice any difficulties and challenges?</h3>
          <p><br>In the beginning I found it hard to ask feedback from different teachers who don't assess me, because I thought their opinion didn't really matter. but then I thought why not? if I get more opinions on my portfolio it can only get better.</p>
          <h3>Do you want to grow in this learning outcome?</h3>
         <p><br>Yes, I want to grow in this learning outcome, I want to ask more feedback to improve my design more then I already do. But I think I already grew compared to last year. So that's a positive progress.

            A classmate of mine didn't know how to put her website online on Hera, so I helped her with that. I explained to her how she could do it and I showed her how to do it. I think it's important to help each other because you can learn from each other and you can help each other out when you don't know something.

              For the first 2 months I only thought it was a good idea to ask feedback from only the assessors because they are gonna judge your portfolio. but at my second review I got the feedback to ask more teachers for feedback on my portfolio. So after that I did. I asked different teachers and I got different opinions about stuff from my portfolio. which is sometimes annoying because 1 person likes something else as the other person. Then you have to look what you like yourself and substantiate your choice.
