            <p>I made a Trello to keep track of what I already have in my portfolio and what I still need to put in. So it is clearer for myself. Because the more I have the less I keep oriented what I already put in my portfolio. so I don't forget to put stuff in.<br><br>For me this is a good way to keep track of everything I already put in my portfolio. This is the first time I worked like this together with my portfolio and I think it works great.</p>

                I decided to make a moodboard about the stuff I like and put it all together to see if there would come out a specific style. I found out that I liked pastel colors, so I found it a good idea to use that.<br>I got the next feedback on this moodboard: <br><strong>"It is good that you made one, but it was better if you could tell more about it, now it just looks like you threw some pictures together."</strong><br><br>I also thought it was a good idea to make a moodboard about Portfolio designs I really like so I also did that. so I could find out what design I wanted to use.<br>I got the following feedback on this moodboard: <strong>"It is smart to make a moodboard with different portfolios to find out what style you like."</strong><br><br>I think this is a good way to find out what design you like and in which color to make it you.

                I also wanted a typography which fits me. So I decided to look through the different fonts Figma has to find the perfect font for me. I put the 12 fonts I liked the best in 1 document and typed out my about me text in 5 fonts to see which one I liked the most. that's how I choose Albert Sans. Just a basic font but clearly readable. Which would fit my pastel colors.<br>I got the following feedback on this font research: I first put it in Lorem Ipsum <br><strong>"Put it in your own text to see how it looks on it you can use ChatGPT for it to generate one for you, and align the text to the left because that makes it easier to read."</strong><br><br>I think this was a good way to find the font which will fit the best to what you prefer and the style you think of.

            <p>
                I thought it was a good idea to use the city of Maastricht in my portfolio because I live there. So I choose 2 of the designs in my portfolio moodboard and pasted Maastricht on it and used my name just to see how it would look. I also made 2 designs without Maastricht just to see if I liked this better, but I didn't so I definitely wanted to use Maastricht. I asked around some people which design they prefered and most prefered my fourth design. I also liked it but it felt like something was missing. So I thought maybe put the whole picture in the back with a little fade and keep the picture clear in my name to make my name visable. I tested this again with multiple people to see if they liked it with or without the city better, and 15 people voted for the picture and 1 without the picture, so for me it was pretty clear to use the picture in the background. That's how I found my design.<br> I got the following feedback on this design:<br> <strong>"Maybe add a line around your name to make it much clearer, and fade the picture a little more."</strong><br>I used this feedback and I think it looks much better now.<br><strong>"You can make the background white and the letters a little lower so the buildings are jumping out more."</strong><br> When I showed my old design he agreed that this looked better so I didn't do anything with this.<br><br>I  think it's good to ask feedback on your design to keep improving it, if you don't like it you don't have to use it. But different people have different opinions and that's how you can make the design look better.

            I went looking for which color I liked for the rest of the page. I put my about text under the design to have a better look and tested 6 more colors next to white. I found out I liked the gray or the white best because it didn't look so messy. But I just didn't feel these colors. I decided to just take 2 colors from the picture of Maastricht and try to match them I made them a little more pastel to match my idea and that's how I found my colors.

            <p>
                For the project part on the home page, I started with 2 designs, one was that when you go to the page you see the first 2 projects and have to click on an arrow to see the other 2 with a picture about the project and a small description. And the other one was with just 4 buttons to go to the project. I liked the first idea more because you get a small idea where the project is about. I asked feedback on both designs:<br> <strong>"I like it that the picture isn't fully in the box which makes it more curious for users to press on the project, and a small overview design makes it more visual so people are more interested to read it."</strong><br><br> I did a little more research about how I could make this page more interesting, and I found a caroussel function, where the projects rotate after some seconds so you can see the projects without pressing through it. To make the use of this easier so you don't have to wait the whole circle, I wanted to add arrows so you can also click through them. I designed it in figma.<br> I also asked feedback on this design: <br><strong> "Maybe you can add dots under the projects as indicator on which project you exactly are and how much there are left.</strong><br>I thought this was a good idea so I used it. I also added a little dot on the upper right of the container so it is clear how long the specific project is shown and how much time you have left on that project.

                for the outcome part on the home page, I didn't really have a hard time deciding what I want. I wanted to make something simple so I though of using the other design I actually made for the project page. <br> I got the following feedback on this: <br><strong>"Maybe because you have an uneven count of learning outcomes, it is a good idea to put them under each other instead of 2-2-1, if you had 6 learning outcomes this was a nice way to present it but for 5 I think it's better to put them under each other.</strong><br> I changed this to look which one I prefer, and I indeed thought this looked better then my previous design.

               I wanted to keep the design for the actual project pages simple but I didn't want it to be boring. Based on what I saw on other portfolios I decided to put the different headings in containers to make it more colorful, and if you search for a heading you can look at the different containers
